# Facial Features Detection

"This project utilizes OpenCV and face_recognition libraries for real-time detection of faces, eyes, noses, and mouths from a live video stream. It's versatile, suitable for security, surveillance, or interactive games. There are two versions: one provides real-time face labeling from a webcam feed (requires a working webcam or else error will be thrown), while the other processes images from the asset folder. To use your own images, place them in the asset folder and rename accordingly."

## Prerequisites

- Python
- OpenCV
- face_recognition module
- Visual Studio


To successfully install the face_recognition module, ensure that you have Visual Studio with C++ development tools installed. This is necessary as face_recognition relies on dlib, which requires the C++ development tools provided by Visual Studio.

Here are the steps:

1. Go to the Visual Studio downloads page: [https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
2. Under the "All downloads" section, click on "Visual Studio 2022" (or the latest version available).
3. On the next page, click on the "Community" edition, which is free for students, open-source contributors, and individuals.
4. During the installation process, make sure to select the "Desktop Development with C++" workload.

After the installation of the face_recognition module, you'll need to execute the following command in your terminal.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Souvik8426/Face_recognisation
```
